    Important Note:
      The features need to be compatible between different class types and instances.
      Any new features need to have their structure documented to ensure compatibility.
      
    Important Note:
      Some features are factors and cannot be on the left of a conditional probability:
      p(A|B,C) #if A is a factor this is invalid.
      The features in this set are indicated by being prefixed with factor_.
      
      Maybe: a prior on that feature could be added to a FeaturePriorAnswers class?
      
    Some Feature Descriptions:
      factor_age - a categorical list of ages of 100 values, from 0 to 100.
         each value is that person's age, so 32 means their age is 32<=a<33.
         the last value means 100 or more.
      factor_gender - a categorical list of two values (male or female)
      seen - whether a film's been seen (true or false)
      rating - the integer rating given to a film (between 0 and 5).

    Fact Descriptions:
      where_history
        error - optional, equals a string identifying the problem (can be 'no_fb_likes', 'no_fb_countries', ..)
        countrylist - optional, a list of tuple-pairs of (country-name, date), where date is the date the person started living there
        citylist - not yet implemented, a list of tuple-pairs of ((city, country), date) where date is as above

      where
        city - a list of dictionaries:
          probability - the probability of being in this city
          item - the (city, country) pair
        country - a list of dictionaries: 
          probability - the probability of being in this country
          item - the country (whole name) TODO Might be better to use country codes or something similar
        uscensus - a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary consists of:
          probability - the probability of the person being in this blockgroup
          level - the geographical level that this item consists of (e.g. blockgroup is what I'm using at the moment)
          item - the id of the blockgroup (or other level)
        ukcensus - a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary consists of:
          probability - the probability of the person being in this Output Area
          level - the geographical level that this item consists of (e.g. oa - output area)
          item - the id of the OA
